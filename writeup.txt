Because length extension attacks rely on a fixed-length unknown value, a fixed 8-digit password allows for easy length extension attacks based
on the message being sent. Using an HMAC instead of just the hash, the hashing is done more than once and uses a secret key derived from hashing to
give better security. Because it is hashing more than once, using a length extension attack is very unlikely and would be more like brute force.

5.2 


In part 2.2, we saw and implemented a hash collision attack. Hash collision attacks allowed us to execute two different programs with the
same digital signature, which had two widely different results in execution. This is a huge problem to the integrity of a system because files
can be modified and execute to take action that can be detrimental to a system without any warning. Threats can be checked with their digital signature
and if they match the expected signature of a trusted program, then that is very dangerous to a system, as it is a breach in security.

a) A timing side-channel could be used to determine the type of error occurs, hence allowing the attacker to continue to use their syatem as a padding oracle.

b) No, it will not stop the padding oracle attack. Because, Padding oracle attacks do not depend on the fault in the padding scheme. 
Padding adds the extra few bits which are necessary for encryption.
